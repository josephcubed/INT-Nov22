# INT-Nov22

This page hosts all my current first year PhD work that I've been doing on the INT data that we gathered on my first observing run in November 2022. This code currently focuses on analysing the data we took of 2015 RR245, but can be adapted in future to look at the other targets we looked at. There are scripts for creating reference catalogues for star matching, for performing sextractor operations (make sure sextractor is actually installed...), for actually matching the frames, and for performing aperture photometry after reduction. Very WIP.

<br>
To-Do:
<ul>
  <li>Add comments explaining code better</li>
  <li>Finish up photometry</li>
  <li>Generalise to any folder (ie target)</li>
  <li>Upload my CCD reduction script too</li>
</ul>
